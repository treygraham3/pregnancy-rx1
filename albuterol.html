<h2>What is Albuterol used for?</h2>
<p>Albuterol is a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) used to relieve symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. It is typically used as a rescue inhaler during asthma attacks or before exercise.</p>

<h2>Is Albuterol safe during pregnancy?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Albuterol is considered safe to use during pregnancy. Proper asthma control is important for the health of both the parent and the baby.</p>

<h2>FDA Pregnancy Risk Explanation</h2>
<p>Albuterol was previously listed as Category C. However, studies and clinical experience have shown it to be safe and effective for managing asthma during pregnancy.</p>

<h2>Safety by Trimester</h2>
<p><strong>1st Trimester:</strong> Safe to use as needed to maintain good asthma control.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Trimester:</strong> Continued use is safe. Ensures good oxygenation for the baby.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Trimester:</strong> Safe when needed. May be used up until delivery under provider guidance.</p>

<h2>Current Recommendation</h2>
<p>Continue using albuterol as prescribed. Do not stop or reduce asthma medications without discussing with your provider. Uncontrolled asthma poses a higher risk than the medication itself.</p>

<h2>Breastfeeding Safety Summary</h2>
<p>Albuterol is safe while breastfeeding. Very little of the medication passes into breast milk and is unlikely to affect the baby.</p>

<h2>Why might Albuterol be prescribed during pregnancy?</h2>
<p>To treat or prevent asthma attacks and ensure proper oxygen delivery to both the pregnant individual and the baby.</p>

<h2>How does Albuterol work?</h2>
<p>It relaxes the muscles around the airways, allowing them to open and make breathing easier during asthma symptoms or attacks.</p>
