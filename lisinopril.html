<h2>What is Lisinopril used for?</h2>
<p>Lisinopril is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to protect the kidneys in people with diabetes. It belongs to a class of drugs called ACE inhibitors.</p>

<h2>Is Lisinopril safe during pregnancy?</h2>
<p><span class="not-safe">No. Lisinopril is <strong class="not-safe">not safe</strong> to take during pregnancy.</span> It can cause serious harm to a developing baby, especially during the second and third trimesters. It may lead to low amniotic fluid levels, poor fetal kidney development, skull abnormalities, and even pregnancy loss.</p>

<h2>FDA Pregnancy Risk Explanation</h2>
<p>Lisinopril was classified as Category D in the first trimester (risk exists, but benefits may outweigh risks) and Category X in the second and third trimesters (known to cause fetal harm). It is <span class="not-safe">absolutely contraindicated</span> later in pregnancy.</p>

<h2>Safety by Trimester</h2>
<p><strong>1st Trimester:</strong> Possible risk of harm. Safer medications are preferred.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Trimester:</strong> <span class="not-safe">Do not use.</span> Can cause fetal kidney damage and other complications.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Trimester:</strong> <span class="not-safe">Strictly avoided.</span> High risk of stillbirth, kidney failure, or skull deformities in the baby.</p>

<h2>What are safer alternatives?</h2>
<p>Talk to your doctor about switching to safer blood pressure medications. Options may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Labetalol</li>
  <li>Nifedipine</li>
  <li>Methyldopa</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is Lisinopril harmful during pregnancy?</h2>
<p>It interferes with a hormone system that is critical for fetal kidney development and blood flow. This can cause severe complications, including death of the fetus or newborn.</p>

<h2>What should I do if I'm taking Lisinopril and find out I'm pregnant?</h2>
<p>Contact your healthcare provider right away. Do not stop any medication without guidance, but <span class="not-safe">Lisinopril should be discontinued as soon as it is safely possible.</span></p>
