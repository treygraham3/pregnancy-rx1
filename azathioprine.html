    <h2>What is Azathioprine used for?</h2>
    <p>Azathioprine is used to suppress the immune system. It helps treat autoimmune conditions like lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. It’s also used in organ transplant patients to prevent rejection.</p>

    <h2>Pregnancy Safety Summary</h2>
    <p>Azathioprine can be used during pregnancy when needed to control autoimmune conditions. Most studies have not shown an increased risk of major birth defects, but some studies suggest a small risk for preterm birth or low birth weight. The benefits of staying on treatment often outweigh potential risks.</p>

    <h2>FDA Pregnancy Risk Explanation</h2>
    <p>Azathioprine was previously classified as Category D, meaning there is potential risk, but the medication may still be necessary in some situations. Under the FDA’s new labeling system, risks and benefits should be reviewed with your healthcare provider based on your condition and treatment needs.</p>

    <h2>Safety by Trimester</h2>
    <p><strong>1st Trimester:</strong> May be used if needed; most data does not show increased birth defect risk.</p>
    <p><strong>2nd Trimester:</strong> Can be continued under medical supervision.</p>
    <p><strong>3rd Trimester:</strong> Often continued to maintain disease control; baby may need blood monitoring after birth.</p>

    <h2>Current Recommendation</h2>
    <p>If you are already on azathioprine and it is helping control your condition, your doctor may recommend continuing it during pregnancy. Stopping it can sometimes lead to a flare-up of your autoimmune disease, which can be harmful for you and the baby.</p>

    <h2>Breastfeeding Safety Summary</h2>
    <p>Azathioprine can be used during breastfeeding in most cases. Only small amounts pass into breast milk. Your baby’s blood count may be monitored if long-term use is needed.</p>

    <h2>Why might Azathioprine be prescribed during pregnancy?</h2>
    <p>For some people with autoimmune diseases, azathioprine may be the best option to keep their disease in remission during pregnancy. Uncontrolled inflammation can lead to pregnancy complications and may harm the baby’s development.</p>

    <h2>How does Azathioprine work?</h2>
    <p>Azathioprine works by suppressing the immune system, which helps reduce inflammation and immune attacks in autoimmune diseases. This allows the body to avoid flare-ups and damage caused by the immune system attacking its own tissues.</p>

    <h2>Common Side Effects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nausea</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Lowered white blood cell count</li>
      <li>Liver enzyme changes</li>
    </ul>
